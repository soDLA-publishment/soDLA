NVIDIA Open NVDLA License and Agreement v1.0

NVIDIA's Deep Learning Accelerator ("NVDLA") is a hardware design that
accelerates inferencing in System-on-a-Chip designs.  Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Open NVDLA License and Agreement, NVIDIA offers its
NVDLA design on a royalty-free, open-source basis, promoting the adoption of
deep learning inferencing in third-party designs and IoT devices, and
expanding the overall market for AI.

By exercising the rights granted hereunder, You accept and agree to be bound
by these terms and conditions.  You are granted the rights hereunder in
consideration of Your agreement to these terms and conditions.  If You do
not agree to these terms and conditions, do not download or use the NVDLA
Specification.

If You are agreeing to these terms and conditions on behalf of a legal
entity, You represent that You have the legal authority to bind the legal
entity to these terms and conditions.

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, You agree as
follows:

1. DEFINITIONS.

"NVDLA Specification" shall mean and include the design information, code,
and documentation used in designing a deep learning accelerator or creating
a DLA Product, which may include:  HDL, netlists, GDSII files, mask works,
architectural descriptions, interface specifications, microcode, software
source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Contributor" shall mean NVIDIA and any owner of a NVDLA Contribution that
NVIDIA has incorporated within the NVDLA Specification.

"Derivative Work" shall mean any work that is based on (or derived from)
any portion of the NVDLA Specification. For the purposes of this License,
Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, any portion of the NVDLA
Specification and Derivative Works thereof.

"DLA Product" shall mean a semiconductor chip product or portions thereof
designed or manufactured in accordance with a NVDLA Specification or a
Derivative Work, including any semiconductor chip product embodying a mask
work included in a NVDLA Specification or a Derivative Work.

"NVDLA" means NVIDIA's Deep Learning Accelerator, a hardware design that
accelerates inferencing in System-on-a-Chip designs.

"NVDLA Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, design, or
inventorship that is intentionally submitted to NVIDIA for inclusion in the
NVDLA Specification by a person authorized to submit the contribution on
behalf of the owner.

"NVDLA Patents" shall mean patents that are necessary to practice the NVDLA
Specification and any Derivative Works.

"NVDLA Patent Rights" shall mean the right to make, have made, use, sell,
offer for sale, and import patents that are necessary to practice the NVDLA
Specification and any Derivative Works.

"Other NVDLA Rights" includes copyright, design right (whether registered or
unregistered), semiconductor topography (mask work) rights, and database
rights to the NVDLA Specification and any Derivative Work.  For the
avoidance of doubt, Other NVDLA Rights does not include patents or
trademarks.

"License" and "Agreement" shall mean the terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, and distribution as set forth in this document.

2. LICENSE TO NVDLA PATENTS.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, NVIDIA and each
Contributor hereby grant to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
license under the NVDLA Patents to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer DLA Products and the NVDLA
Specification, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed either by (i)
their Contribution(s) alone or (ii) the combination of their NVDLA
Contribution(s) with the portion of the NVDLA Specification to which such
NVDLA Contribution(s) was submitted.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any portion of the
NVDLA Specification, a NVDLA Contribution incorporated within the NVDLA
Specification, or any portion of a DLA Product directly or contributorily
infringes any patent, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
License and Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

3. LICENSE TO OTHER NVDLA RIGHTS.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, NVIDIA and each
Contributor hereby grant to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Other NVDLA Rights to
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the NVDLA Specification and such Derivative
Works, and to commercially exploit any mask works included in the NVDLA
Specification or such Derivative Works.

4. REDISTRIBUTION.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the NVDLA Specification or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
provided that You meet the following conditions:

  1. You must give any other recipients of the NVDLA Specification or
